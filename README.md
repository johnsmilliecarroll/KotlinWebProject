# Full Stack JVM & JS App/Game

This repository is built off of this tutorial: [Building a Full Stack Web App with Kotlin Multiplatform](https://play.kotlinlang.org/hands-on/Full%20Stack%20Web%20App%20with%20Kotlin%20Multiplatform/).

It was originally a clone of [this repo](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/web-app-react-kotlin-js-gradle), modified for the tutorial and further changed to make something unique.

To start the program, build the project with Gradle and choose the run option under shoppinglist/Tasks/application/. Then go to [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/).
